# Advent of code 2020
My solutions to [Advent of Code 2020.](https://www.adventofcode.com)
 When doing the solutions, I chose to go with clear and readable code instead of code golfing.
While this may result in longer solutions, I believe that it will benefit me better in the long run and
teach me more than code golfing, doing nasty hacks and writing everything in te main funcion.
