My solutions to [Advent of Code 2020.](https://www.adventofcode.com)

When doing the solutions, I chose to go with clear and readable code instead of code golfing.
While this may result in longer solutions, I believe that it will benefit me better in the long run and
teach me more than code golfing, doing nasty hacks and writing everything in the main funcion.  

With run_all.sh you can run the puzzle1 and puzzle2 of all days.
