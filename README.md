My solutions for [Advent of Code 2020.](https://www.adventofcode.com)

This was the second year that I participated in Advent of Code,
and the first year that I actually put a notable effort in trying
to solve the puzzles. Some were pretty easy, but some were very hard. There was a lot of 
spaghetti code and bad design choices. But this year's puzzles taught me a lot. It was fun to think outside the box and
get some variation to coding at work. But especially helpful was to go through 
the solutions with others and compare approaches (shoutout to my colleague [Kalle Lämsä](https://github.com/coocos), 
who was a huge help in getting a better understanding of the problems and their solutions). I also got a better 
understanding of what I know and what I don't know, which gives a good start for learning in the future.


I tried to keep the code readable and organized, but on some days all I could do was just to brute-force the solution 
and pretty much leave the code as it is after that. If I have enough time at some point, I will refactor the solutions.

The days are under the aoc/ folder. In each folder:
- There is a separate puzzle1.py and puzzle2.py.
- input.txt contains the full puzzle input.
- input_.txt, if exists, contains the demo input.
- puzzles.txt contains the puzzle problems.  

With the run_all.sh located in the top level folder you can run the puzzle1 and puzzle2 of all days.
