My solutions for [Advent of Code 2020.](https://www.adventofcode.com)

When doing the solutions, I chose to go with clear and readable code instead of code golfing.
While this may result in longer solutions, I believe that it will benefit me better in the long run and
teach me more than code golfing, doing nasty hacks and writing everything in the main funcion.

The days are under the aoc/ folder. In each folder:
- There is a separate puzzle1.py and puzzle2.py.
- input.txt contains the full puzzle input.
- input_.txt, if exists, contains the demo input.
- puzzles.txt contains the puzzle problems.  

With the run_all.sh located in the top level folder you can run the puzzle1 and puzzle2 of all days.
